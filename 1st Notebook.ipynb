    "My code utilizes a lists to store numerous fortunate cookie fortunes and takes an input from user asking if they would like to partake, if yes is selected the imported random function will randomly choose a fortune (or index) from the list and print it out for the user, giving them their fortune. Simaltenously, I have a variable n set equal to 0 that will serve as the conditional for the while loop, the while loop serves to make the program more fluid--after recieving a fortunte there wont be an abrupt end, instead the user will be prompted to continue or to finish and depending on what they choice they will get another fortune or goodbye, respectively. \n"
